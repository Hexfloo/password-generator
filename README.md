# Password Generator Chrome Extension :hash::arrows_clockwise:
With this Chrome extension, you can generate unique and random passwords based on user specifications.<br> This project was inspired mainly by [this cybersecurity lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuy4cEXpXEE), and was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can also view the manifest.json file that is mandatory for chrome.

## Why a password generator
Strong passwords can be a valuable line of defence against malicious attacks and unwanted access to personal accounts, many of those accounts contain personal information that shouldn't be attained by ill-intentioned adversaries. Weak passwords are an easy target for hackers, but strong passwords are remarkably more difficult to crack.

## CS50
This project was made by me as a final project for Harvard's CS50.<br>
This course is an introduction to computer science taught on Harvard University campus as well as online. It includes subjects such as data structures, algorithms, memory allocation, cybersecurity, frameworks and also several programming languages: C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
